# Partner Program: A New Way to Earn with CDS

With the CDS Partner Program, you can monetize your platform by integrating our swap functionality. Every transaction facilitated through your dApp using the CDS Swap UI contributes to your earnings. This is a seamless way to generate passive income while offering users a reliable and efficient swapping experience.

# CDS Partner Program: Revenue Sharing Model

To empower our partners and provide them with a sustainable way to earn, the **CDS Earn Partner Program** operates on a revenue-sharing model that rewards partners for every trade executed through their integration.

# Revenue Share Models

CDS offers two revenue-sharing options, allowing partners to choose a model that best fits their strategy:

- **60/40 Share Model** — Partners receive 60% of the trade fee, while 40% goes to CDS.

- **70/30 Share Model** — Partners receive 70% of the trade fee, while 30% goes to CDS.

- For any custom revenue share model, contact CDS team via [discord](https://discord.gg/TfsEJz5jp3).

# Trading Fee Structure

Each trade executed through the partner’s integration incurs a flat fee of **1.2 ADA**. This fee is split according to the selected revenue-sharing model, ensuring that partners earn a percentage of every trade facilitated through their platform.
